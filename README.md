# Linux 'Comfy Chair'

You know how it is, your own Linux is set up like your favorite comfy chair - everything is close to hand, set up the way you want and there are no surprises. That's why its so annoying to set up a new computer or virtual machine, especially if you are testing stuff (like this script!!) that needs both a certain amount of installed dependencies and a dependable state.

Hence this script. Adapted from my similar scripts to bootstrap a new Raspberry PI system and Windows 10 'WSL', but for pure (Debian Based) Linux. Primary usage has been tested with Ubuntu though it should work with any Debian-based distribution.

**Note that the script is geared towards and tested on _server_ versions more than Desktop ones, though should work for both.**

## Prerequisites

At absolute minimum, you need a working system that you can log into, either locally or over ssh. The only 2 other absolute requirements are that ```git``` and ```sudo``` are installed. In 99% of cases this is already the case, however some minimal inages may not have these - for example the standard Docker Ubuntu image does NOT.
The script will install any other missing base dependencies that are critical for the rest of the script to function.

## Note: WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

This system has also been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 running under WSL2 and works perfectly as far as I can see with the below caveats:

* **Do not enable the 'Docker' module in this script**. If you wish to use Docker under WSL then please install the '**Docker Desktop**' under windows itself. This already is very well and tightly integrated with WSL. Just ensure that you have Docker Desktop running in the background. As a side effect, your Docker containers in Windows will now run using the WSL so will be proper linux containers.
* Due to the lack of background services, you will need to manually start Postgresql, Nginx, ssh etc as required. I use a script in my home dir so I can enable and disable at will when needed.
* This may work under WSL version 1, and has worked in the past, however I no longer test against this version of WSL. In all cases it is worthwhile and very easy to upgrade to WSL Version 2

I will continue to ensure compatibility with WSL as I now use this for one of my main development environments.

## General Information

The script works on a bare newly installed system and provides the following functionality :

* Updated to the latest package versions from Ubuntu / Debian upstream.
* Have the `build-essential` package installed plus all required support libraries to enable the below functionality to work.
* The Latest version of [`Git`][git] installed. A skeleton `.gitconfig` will be set up with a few aliases.
* The [`Ruby`][ruby] scripting language installed via [`Rbenv`][rbenv] with the current version of Rails installed as standard along with several other common gems.
* [`Node.js`][node] both the most recent LTS version and latest stable version via [`NVM`][nvm]. The LTS version is activated by default.
* The [`Python`][python] scripting language both the latest 2.7 and 3.x versions via [`Pyenv`][pyenv]
* Install the latest STABLE [`Perl`][perl] scripting language via [`Perlbrew`][perlbrew] with cpan and cpanm pre-installed and configured. Several PERL modules that make cpan easier are also pre-installed
* Enable resolution of WINS hostnames
* Install Nginx web server, php and Postgresql database (disabled by default)
* Install Docker and Docker-compose (disabled by default)

## Security

Please be aware that no attempt has been made to Secure or harden the final
Linux system. This is something you will need to do yourself. Indeed, if your
server is public, I'd advise that a very restrictive firewall blocking
everything IN except for SSH is the first thing you do before even running this
script!
No reponsibility will be taken for security breaches on systems set up with this
script.

## Usage

The simplest way to use this script is to clone into a completely new Ubuntu environment.

From the terminal run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seapagan/linux-comfy-chair.git
cd ubuntu-win-bootstrap
./comfy-chair.sh
```

## To-Do

* More robust fall-over on already configured systems. If Rbenv etc are already installed then ignore installing that part
* set up configuration keys to determine what modules to install

### Further proposed modules

* Vagrant
* Samba
